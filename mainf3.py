 Does anyone know that feeling when you know something totally unexpected is 
about to haPpen? What seemed to be the most peaceful and antisocial trip of 
their lives while having intriguing conversations with Tutankhamun and his 
unalive mates, took a turn which the first-year Computer Science students of 
CoventrY University would not have seen coming. It was, let’s say… quite the 
experience.
 Fine sand, deadly heat and litTle to no humidity in the air — all seemed to 
make arriving at the pyramids like a reward the same group of students I told 
you about earlier would put in one of their games, after completing MMMCCLXXI 
levels.
 When they finally entered one of the pyramids, nothing seemed to look unusual, exactly like what they show you in documentaries: chunks of dust, absent 
colours, and walls full of hieroglyphs.
 “We’re now going to split into VI groups of III and explore different areas of the not-so-regularly-shaped-anymore pyramid. You can choose people you’re 
friends with, but mainly focus on those whom you know least. It will allow you 
to observe everything in a better ligHt and get to know each other. Be careful. 
Remember, eyes on the ground. If you don’t see eye to eye though, negate the 
ground and look up; who knows what you may stumble across?” said Simon with a 
devilish smile on his face. Everyone has to do what Simon says. Simon says it, 
you do it.


Which group would you like to go forward with?
Press A for Group A or press B for Group B.

Out of all the possible paths you could choose from, group IV decided to follow the longest, darkest, and narrowest. Henry, Jack, and Robert were almost immediately starting to regret their decision, but that was about to change in the next XXX minutes, which felt like str(decades). At some point during their exploration, it looked like the tunnel was gaining more and more width, until it became sort of like a room; causing a change in everyone’s intention of what they should do next. Henry was convinced they should go back and wait till the other groups would make their way back, while Robert wanted to carry on and not look back.
Would  you like the group to CARRY ON or GO BACK?
